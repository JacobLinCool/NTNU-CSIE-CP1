# HW 0505 Bonus: An Interesting Code

資工系 114 級 林振可 (41047029S)

## Original Code

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int ui = 0;
unsigned short us = 0;
signed int si = -1;

int main() {
    int64_t r1 = ui + si;
    int64_t r2 = us + si;
    printf("%ld %ld\n", r1, r2);
}
```

### Result

```
4294967295 -1
```

## Explicit Conversion

Trying to use explicit conversion to reproduce the same result.

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int ui = 0;
unsigned short us = 0;
signed int si = -1;

int64_t get_r1() {
    return (int64_t)((unsigned int)ui + (unsigned int)si);
}

int64_t get_r2() {
    return (int64_t)((signed int)us + (signed int)si);
}

int main() {
    printf("%ld %ld\n", get_r1(), get_r2());
}
```

### Result

```
4294967295 -1
```

## Conclusion

### r1

1. Promote type of `si` from `signed int` to `unsigned int`
2. Get sum of two `unsigned int` (`ui` and `si`), which is `4294967295`
3. Convert type of `4294967295` from `unsigned int` to `int64_t`
4. Now we have `r1` which is `4294967295` of type `int64_t`

### r2

1. Promote type of `us` from `unsigned short` to `signed int`
2. Get sum of two `signed int` (`us` and `si`), which is `-1`
3. Convert type of `-1` from `signed int` to `int64_t`
4. Now we have `r2` which is `-1` of type `int64_t`
